Goals:
1) Solve Sudoku puzzles as fast as possible (should be efficient as well) | This should apply to at least one of the solving methods
2) Have a easy to use GUI (simple, buttons, few actions, very little knowledge required)
3) Be able to easily import a sudoku puzzle (allow multiple types of input)
4) Be able to select multiple types of solving methods (a couple different solving algorithms or solving methods)
5) Be able to generate new sudoku puzzles that can be solved logically (human solvable with no guessing)
6) Be able to solve different sizes and difficulties of sudoku puzzles (bigger or smaller grids, varying difficulties, and numbers/letters/etc)
7) Display solve time, and store it to a log file

8) Add a clear button, or a restart button (or something similar)


Java Setup:
1) App Class with main method (SudokuSolver.java)
2) Algorithms class with different algorithm methods (Algorithms.java)
3) UI Class with all of the UI elements (I think idk) (GUI.java)
4) Import Class that handles all importing and processing (Import.java)
